This is Crypt::IDEA version 1.03, an XS-based implementation of the
patent-encumbered IDEA cryptography algorithm.  It's designed
to take full advantage of Crypt::CBC when desired. 
up to 448 bits (56 bytes) long.  This module builds on many plaforms, 
with a little assistance.

Prerequisites
-------------

For the full test suite to run, Crypt::CBC, version 1.22 or higher
is required (recommended is 1.25 or higher), however this module 
is not mandatory for standalone IDEA use.  

Installing Crypt::Blowfish
--------------------------

nothing unusual:

	1. perl Makefile.PL
	2. make
	3. make test
	4. sudo make install

Notes
-----

This module has been tested successfully against the following:
Linux 2.0.X (x86)
Linux 2.2.X (x86, PPC, Alpha, m68k)
Linux 2.4.X (x86)
Mac OS X 10.4.X

Perl 5.004_01, 5.004_04, 5.005_03, 5.6.0, 5.6.1, 5.8.*

To build on Mac OS X (at least 10.4.X since that's what I've
got in front of me at the moment, the following command needs
to be executed prior to issuing `make`:

ln -s /usr/include/ppc/endian.h /usr/include/endian.h

Please send other successful OS/platform combinations to:
